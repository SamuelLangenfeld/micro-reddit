This was an exercise from the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-with-active-record)

I made a simple reddit-like database with rails. I used Active Record to create models for users, posts, and comments. Posts and comments both belong to a user while the user has many posts and comments. Each comment belongs to a post as well. I learned how to create foreign key constraints through the console when generating models and I ended up doing a lot of database migrations to make sure I knew how the tables and references functioned.
